# MutualFundsAPI
ASP.NET Core Web API that serves REST endpoints for the portfolio tracker app.

The Swagger docs are available at http://www.myportfoliotracker.com/index.html when the project is run or deployed (the domain name is just mapped in the hosts file to the IP address).

The Database folder has the necessary DDL statements to create the tables and insert some data into it. This repo *does not* pull in historical data and load it into the database however, that has to be done separately.
